# The Port
The Port is my current website template and structure, minus my content and images. Index and template HTML file and CSS, un-minified. SEO Tags also removed but in place ready to be added to. My template is availible to all for, to use for free, as long as you keep the copyright displayed at the bottom. 
## Looking for help?

## How I created it...
I started this website from scratch with HTML, then once I added all my chosen content in HTML tags, I began to add CSS to make everything look better. I used Visual Studio Code on a Firebase server to begin with then moved it to my main hosting server. I used [MinifyHTML](http://minifycode.com/html-minifier) online when I published my site to protect some of my code as well as make the content load faster by taking out any un-needed parts. When managing and creating my site, I used the Beautify plugin in VS Code to indent and format everything properly.
