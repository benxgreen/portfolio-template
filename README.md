# The Port
The Port is my current website template and structure, minus my content and images. Index and template HTML file and CSS, un-minified. SEO Tags also removed but in place ready to be added to. My template is availible to all for, to use for free, as long as you keep the copyright displayed at the bottom. 
## Looking for help?
