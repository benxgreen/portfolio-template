# Portfolio Template
This GitHub repository is the base of my current website template and structure, minus my content and images (which have been replaced by royalty-free images on Unsplash). All the template HTML and CSS files are un-minified allowing you to customize as you please. SEO Tags also removed but in place ready to be added to. My template is availible to all for, to use for free, as long as you keep the copyright displayed at the bottom.

## How I created it...
I started this website from scratch with HTML, then once I added all my chosen content in HTML tags, I began to add CSS to make everything look better. I used Visual Studio Code on a Firebase server to begin with then moved it to my main hosting server. I used [MinifyHTML](http://minifycode.com/html-minifier) online when I published my site to protect some of my code as well as make the content load faster by taking out any un-needed parts. When managing and creating my site, I used the Beautify plugin in VS Code to indent and format everything properly.
